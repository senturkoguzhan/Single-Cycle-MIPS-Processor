# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor

### Description
This project is a single cycle MIPS processor in structural and behavioral verilog.
We have Data Memory and Instruction Memory. The instructions must be loaded to the instruction memory and the data must be in data memory.
My datapad support add,and,or,sub,lui,slt,sltu,addi,addiu,lb,lh,lw,sw,sh.

### RoadMap
  I will add other instructions to datapad as soon as possible.
