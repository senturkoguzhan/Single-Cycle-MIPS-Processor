# Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor

### Description
* This project is a single cycle MIPS processor in structural and behavioral verilog.
* We have Data Memory and Instruction Memory. 
* The instructions must be loaded to the instruction memory and the data must be in data memory.
* My datapad support _add, and, or, sub, lui, slt, sltu, addi, addiu, lb, lh, lw, sw, sh._

### RoadMap
  I will add other instructions to datapad as soon as possible.
